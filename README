Go Chat! - the stupid chat server written in Go.

It's stupidly simple:

1. Compile it
2. Run it
3. Telnet into localhost:9999

Now, a bunch of features is needed:

 * Nice formatting (screw Sprintf + TCPConn.Write() :/)
   - this is a serious point, I can't figure out wtf is going on.
 * Make sure we get rid of Client struct when client
   disconnects.

Please do that.
